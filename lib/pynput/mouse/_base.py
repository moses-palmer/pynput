class Listener(AbstractListener):
    """A listener for mouse events.

    Instances of this class can be used as context managers. This is equivalent
    to the following code::

        listener.start()
        try:
            listener.wait()
            with_statements()
        finally:
            listener.stop()

    This class inherits from :class:`threading.Thread` and supports all its
    methods. It will set :attr:`daemon` to ``True`` when created.

    All callback arguments are optional; a callback may take less arguments
    than actually passed, but not more, unless they are optional.

    Please see `Platform limitations` for more information about when the
    ``injected`` argument to the callbacks below can be trusted.

    :param callable on_move: The callback to call when mouse move events occur.

        It will be called with the arguments ``(x, y, injected)``, where ``(x,
        y)`` is the new pointer position and ``injected`` whether the event was
        injected and thus not generated by an actual input device. If this
        callback raises :class:`StopException` or returns ``False``, the
        listener is stopped.

    :param callable on_click: The callback to call when a mouse button is
        clicked.

        It will be called with the arguments ``(x, y, button, pressed,
        injected)``, where ``(x, y)`` is the new pointer position, ``button``
        is one of the :class:`Button`, ``pressed`` is whether the button was
        pressed and ``injected`` whether the event was injected and thus not
        generated by an actual input device.

        If this callback raises :class:`StopException` or returns ``False``,
        the listener is stopped.

    :param callable on_scroll: The callback to call when mouse scroll
        events occur.

        It will be called with the arguments ``(x, y, dx, dy, injected)``,
        where ``(x, y)`` is the new pointer position, and ``(dx, dy)`` is the
        scroll vector and ``injected`` whether the event was injected and thus
        not generated by an actual input device.

        If this callback raises :class:`StopException` or returns ``False``,
        the listener is stopped.

    :param bool suppress: Whether to suppress events. Setting this to ``True``
        will prevent the input events from being passed to the rest of the
        system.

    :param kwargs: Any non-standard platform dependent options. These should be
        prefixed with the platform name thus: ``darwin_``, ``xorg_`` or
        ``win32_``.

        Supported values are:

        ``darwin_intercept``
            A callable taking the arguments ``(event_type, event)``, where
            ``event_type`` is any mouse related event type constant, and
            ``event`` is a ``CGEventRef``.

            This callable can freely modify the event using functions like
            ``Quartz.CGEventSetIntegerValueField``. If this callable does not
            return the event, the event is suppressed system wide.

        ``win32_event_filter``
            A callable taking the arguments ``(msg, data)``, where ``msg`` is
            the current message, and ``data`` associated data as a
            `MSLLHOOKSTRUCT <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-msllhookstruct>`_.

            If this callback returns ``False``, the event will not
            be propagated to the listener callback.

            If ``self.suppress_event()`` is called, the event is suppressed
            system wide.
