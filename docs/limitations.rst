Platform limitations
--------------------

*pynput* aims at providing a unified *API* for all supported platforms. In some
cases, however, that is not entirely possible.


Linux
~~~~~

On *Linux*, *pynput* uses *X*, so the following must be true:

*  An *X server* must be running.

*  The environment variable ``$DISPLAY`` must be set.

The latter requirement means that running *pynput* over *SSH* generally will not
work. To work around that, make sure to set ``$DISPLAY``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ DISPLAY=:0 python -c 'import pynput'

Furthermore, detecting injected events is not supported. A partial workaround
exists for keyboard events hovever; events generated by *pynput* running in the
same process will be detected.


Mac OSX
~~~~~~~

Recent versions of *Mac OSX* restrict monitoring of the keyboard for security
reasons. For that reason, one of the following must be true:

*  The process must run as root.

*  Your application must be white listed under *Enable access for assistive
   devices*. Note that this might require that you package your application,
   since otherwise the entire *Python* installation must be white listed.

Please note that this does not apply to monitoring of the mouse or trackpad.


Windows
~~~~~~~

On *Windows*, virtual events sent by *other* processes may not be received.
This library takes precautions, however, to dispatch any virtual events
generated to all currently running listeners of the current process.
